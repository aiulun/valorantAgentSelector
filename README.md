## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Used an existing API and decided on what to use in terms of data available. Items used from API: Profile Picture, Full Picture, Abilities, and Role. Added click events to handle profile pictures that are clicked and DOM manipulation to update the abilities and full pictures. 

Created a drop down for filtering agents based on role to simplify list and allow users to get more targeted agents. 

## Lessons Learned:

Optimizing loading times of pictures since they're pulled from API.
